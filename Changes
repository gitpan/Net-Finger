Revision history for Perl extension Net::Finger.

1.0   Tue Dec 15 16:32:05 EST 1998
	- Wrote it in about 30 minutes while staying late at work. Cleaned
	  it up the next day for CPAN submission. See the BUGS section in
	  the pod for the things I'd like to work into it sometime.

1.01  Sun Dec 20 12:27:51 CST 1998
	- Fixed a stupid bug with apostrophes in quoted strings. Thanks
	  muchly to James Mastros for pointing this out.

1.02  Thu Feb 11 10:24:14 EST 1999
	- D'oh! Thanks to a suggestion from Chris "Pudge" Nandor, it now does
	  proper newline translation in the response from the server.
